# Electric_Motor_Temperature_Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the internal temperatures of permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) using machine learning. Accurately estimating component temperatures (like the rotor and stator) is crucial for preventing motor damage and optimizing performance in electric vehicles and industrial automation.
